# NATOURS

Little application showing vacation tours.

Implemented authentification using JWT tokens.

Tours cards include some information that is stored in mongoDB and retrieved using mongoose.

Also some 3rd party libraries was used such as Stripe checkout for tour booking, mapty for geolocation.

Deployed this app to heroku but it started to charge money.
